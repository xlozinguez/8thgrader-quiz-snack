# 8th Grader Quiz App - Development Session Summary

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Create a mobile quiz app for 8th-grade students with automated CI/CD deployment to Expo Snack.

**Current State:** React Native app with Expo SDK 53.0.0, 460+ flashcards across Civics, Algebra, and Science subjects.

## Problem We Were Solving
**Main Issue:** CI deployment was reporting success but creating anonymous Snacks instead of account-owned Snacks under the user's Expo account (xlozingueztfx).

**User's Explicit Requirement:** "the snack shouldn't be published anonymously and always under my account"

## Working Snack
- **Current Working Snack:** https://snack.expo.dev/vfjOLwzqUpUz0UBgNM8aL ‚úÖ
- **Desired Account Location:** https://expo.dev/accounts/xlozingueztfx/snacks (currently 404 ‚ùå)

## Approaches Tried & Pitfalls

### 1. EAS CLI Approach ‚ùå
**What we tried:** Using `eas-cli` for modern Expo project management
**Pitfalls encountered:**
- Wrong package name: Used `@expo/eas-cli` instead of `eas-cli`
- Project creation errors: "Experience with id does not exist" 
- EAS update failed with GraphQL errors

**Lessons learned:** 
- EAS CLI is meant for app store deployments, not Snacks
- Package name matters: `npm install -g eas-cli` not `@expo/eas-cli`

### 2. Expo Publish Approach ‚ùå  
**What we tried:** Using `expo publish` with account ownership
**Pitfalls encountered:**
- Command deprecated: "expo publish is not supported in the local CLI, please use eas update instead"
- Flag issues: `--non-interactive` not supported, should use `$CI=1`

**Lessons learned:**
- `expo publish` is completely deprecated in modern Expo CLI
- Documentation may be outdated regarding supported commands

### 3. Snack SDK Approach ‚ùå
**What we tried:** Using `snack-sdk` npm package programmatically
**Pitfalls encountered:** 
- Creates anonymous Snacks despite setting `user` field
- SDK doesn't have proper account ownership functionality
- Misleading URLs generated but Snacks not actually owned by account

**Lessons learned:**
- Snack SDK is primarily for anonymous/public Snacks
- Setting user field doesn't guarantee account ownership

### 4. Direct Snack API Approach üîÑ (Latest)
**What we're trying:** Direct HTTP calls to Snack API with authentication
**Current status:** Implementation complete, needs testing

## CI/CD Workflow Issues & Fixes

### YAML Syntax Problems ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issues encountered:**
1. **Bash brace syntax in YAML:** `|| { ... }` caused parsing errors
2. **Heredoc complications:** Multi-line heredoc in YAML caused syntax errors  
3. **JSON escaping:** Complex JSON in heredoc conflicted with YAML parsing

**Solutions applied:**
- Replaced bash brace syntax with proper conditional structure
- Replaced heredoc with single-line echo commands
- Used external files for JSON payloads to avoid escaping issues

### Authentication ‚úÖ WORKING
**Status:** Successfully authenticating as user "xlozingueztfx"
**Evidence:** CI logs show `npx expo whoami` returns correct username
**Secret configured:** `EXPO_TOKEN` is properly set in GitHub repository secrets

## Current Implementation (Latest Approach)

### File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (publish-snack job)
**Strategy:** Direct Snack API approach with comprehensive file inclusion

**Key improvements:**
1. **Skip deprecated commands** - No more `expo publish` attempts
2. **Comprehensive file inclusion** - All source files (App.js, screens/, data/) in API payload
3. **Proper authentication** - Bearer token + additional headers
4. **Response parsing** - Extract Snack ID for correct URL generation
5. **Better error handling** - Detailed logging for debugging

**API call structure:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://snack.expo.dev/api/v2/snack/save" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EXPO_TOKEN" \
  -H "Expo-Platform: web" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" \
  -d @/tmp/snack-payload.json
```

**Payload structure:**
```json
{
  "manifest": {
    "name": "8th Grader Quiz App",
    "slug": "8th-grader-quiz-app", 
    "owner": "xlozingueztfx",
    "sdkVersion": "53.0.0",
    "platforms": ["ios", "android", "web"],
    "description": "Interactive quiz app for 8th grade students with 460+ flashcards"
  },
  "code": {
    "App.js": "...",
    "app.json": "...",
    "package.json": "...",
    "data/flashcards.js": "...",
    "screens/HomeScreen.js": "...",
    "screens/SubjectScreen.js": "...",
    "screens/QuizScreen.js": "...",
    "screens/ResultsScreen.js": "..."
  }
}
```

## App Configuration

### Current app.json
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "8th Grade Quiz App",
    "slug": "8th-grader-quiz-app", 
    "version": "1.0.1",
    "sdkVersion": "53.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "platforms": ["ios", "android", "web"],
    "owner": "xlozingueztfx"  // Key for account ownership
  }
}
```

### Dependencies (Expo SDK 53)
- expo: ^53.0.0
- react: 19.0.0  
- react-native: 0.79.4
- @react-navigation/native: ^6.1.18
- @react-navigation/stack: ^6.4.1
- All navigation and UI dependencies updated for SDK 53

## Test Results
**Test Suite:** ‚úÖ All 19 tests passing
**Coverage:** ~5.58% (acceptable for UI-heavy app)
**Linting:** ‚úÖ Passes
**Security Audit:** ‚úÖ No critical vulnerabilities

## Latest Results (July 2, 2025)

### ‚úÖ CI Success with Package Updates
**Status:** CI deployment completed successfully after fixing package compatibility issues
**Commit:** `43eba9e` - Updated expo@53.0.15 and jest-expo@~53.0.8 
**All Jobs Passed:**
- ‚úÖ Tests (Node 18.x, 20.x) 
- ‚úÖ Data integrity validation
- ‚úÖ Security audit 
- ‚úÖ Expo compatibility check
- ‚úÖ Package deployment

### üîç Direct Snack API Results
**Approach Tested:** HTTP POST to `https://snack.expo.dev/api/v2/snack/save`
**Authentication:** ‚úÖ Working (xlozingueztfx confirmed)
**API Response:** ‚ùå HTML instead of JSON (likely endpoint issue)
**Deployment Package:** ‚úÖ Successfully created and uploaded as GitHub artifact

### üì¶ What Was Successfully Created
- **Artifact:** `expo-snack-package.zip` (76MB, 24,788 files)
- **Download URL:** https://github.com/xlozinguez/8thgrader-quiz-snack/actions/runs/16014041860/artifacts/3445626985
- **Contains:** All source files, dependencies, and Snack-ready configuration
- **Retention:** 30 days

## Next Steps (Updated July 2, 2025)

### 1. Manual Snack Creation üéØ RECOMMENDED
**Since API automation failed, use the prepared package manually:**
1. Download the `expo-snack-package` artifact from the CI run
2. Visit https://snack.expo.dev while logged into xlozingueztfx account  
3. Create a new Snack
4. Upload/copy the files from the package
5. Set the correct dependencies from the generated package.json

### 2. Alternative API Approaches üîß
**If we want to retry automation:**
- Test different Snack API endpoints (v1 vs v2)
- Try authentication via session cookies instead of bearer token
- Use Expo CLI's internal API calls
- Investigate snack-sdk authentication methods

### 3. Browser Automation ü§ñ
**For future automation:**
- Use Playwright to automate the Snack web interface
- Log in programmatically and create Snacks via UI automation
- More reliable than API but slower

## Key Files Modified

### Primary Files:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline with Snack publishing
- `app.json` - Updated with account ownership and SDK 53
- `package.json` - Dependencies updated for Expo SDK 53

### Source Files (Working):
- `App.js` - Main app component with navigation
- `screens/HomeScreen.js` - Subject selection
- `screens/SubjectScreen.js` - Unit selection and mode choice  
- `screens/QuizScreen.js` - Flashcard and quiz functionality
- `screens/ResultsScreen.js` - Results and progress tracking
- `data/flashcards.js` - 460+ flashcards across subjects

## Critical Success Metrics
1. ‚úÖ **CI runs without YAML errors**
2. ‚úÖ **Authentication successful (xlozingueztfx)**  
3. ‚úÖ **Package compatibility fixed** (Expo 53.0.15, jest-expo 53.0.8)
4. ‚úÖ **Deployment package created** (Ready for manual Snack creation)
5. ‚ùå **Automated account-owned Snack creation** (API endpoint issues)
6. üîÑ **Manual Snack creation required** (Next user action)

## Quick Start for Next Session

### ‚úÖ Session Complete - Snack Entry Point Fixed

**What was accomplished:**
- Fixed Expo package compatibility issues
- **FIXED: Snack entry point issue** - Added `index.js` to deployment package
- Simplified `index.js` for better Snack compatibility  
- All CI checks passing
- Authentication working correctly

**Latest fix (Commit `d5541a5`):**
- ‚úÖ Added `index.js` to CI workflow file copying
- ‚úÖ Added `index.js` to API payload  
- ‚úÖ Simplified `index.js` to use standard `registerRootComponent`
- ‚úÖ Should resolve "no default export of 'index.js'" error

**Next user action:**
1. **Download the updated deployment package:**
   - New CI run will generate updated package with `index.js` included
   - Or use the manual workaround below

2. **Create Snack manually:**
   - Go to https://snack.expo.dev (while logged into xlozingueztfx)
